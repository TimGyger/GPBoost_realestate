Comments on computational efficiency for GPBoost
================================================

Estimation/training of random effects models and Gaussian process (GP) models, in particular, can be computationally demanding, and this issue translates to the GPBoost algorithm. Below, we list some strategies for computationally efficient inference.

Adjusting the way how hyperparameters (*of random effects / GP models*) are chosen
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* It can be faster to set ``optimizer_cov`` to ``nelder_mead`` when having large data as this can lead to reduced computational cost and memory usage. For small data, however, setting ``optimizer_cov`` to ``gradient_descent`` or ``fisher_scoring`` (*the latter for Gaussian likelihoods only*) can lead to faster calculations compared to the option ``nelder_mead``. Examples:

   * ``gp_model$set_optim_params(params=list(optimizer_cov="nelder_mead"))`` (R) / ``gp_model.set_optim_params(params={"optimizer_cov": "nelder_mead"})`` (Python)

* Setting the parameter ``train_gp_model_cov_pars`` to false in the function ``gpb.train`` can also make training faster for the GPBoost algorithm as covariance parameters are not trained. In this case, you can consider them as tuning parameters that can be chosen using, e.g., cross-validation. As a middle ground, you can also increase the convergence tolerance for the hyperparameter estimation. This means that hyperparameters are estimated less accurately but faster. Examples:

   * ``gpb.train(..., train_gp_model_cov_pars=FALSE))`` (R) / ``gpb.train(..., train_gp_model_cov_pars=False)`` (Python)

   * ``gp_model$set_optim_params(params=list(delta_rel_conv=1e-3))`` (R) / ``gp_model.set_optim_params(params={"delta_rel_conv": 1e-3})`` (Python)

* To get a better understanding of the progress of the hyperparameter optimization, set the option ``trace`` to true in the ``gp_model``. Examples:

   * ``gp_model$set_optim_params(params=list(trace=TRUE))`` (R) / ``gp_model.set_optim_params(params={"trace": True})`` (Python)

Adjusting Gaussian process models / using approximate models
------------------------------------------------------------
* For Gaussian process models, the compactly supported covariance functions (``cov_function``) options ``wendland`` and ``exponential_tapered`` can speed up computations and reduce memory usage. The taper range parameter ``cov_fct_taper_range`` controls the amount of sparsity in the covariance matrices and thus the computational cost and memory usage. See `here <https://projecteuclid.org/journals/annals-of-statistics/volume-47/issue-2/Estimation-and-prediction-using-generalized-Wendland-covariance-functions-under-fixed/10.1214/17-AOS1652.short>`__ for more information on the methodological background.

* The GPBoost library also implements a Vecchia approximation for Gaussian processes. This option is recommended for Gaussian processes with Gaussian likelihoods and low-dimensional input features. For non-Gaussian likelihoods, it currently does not yet scale as well. To activate this, set ``vecchiac_approx`` to true and choose the ``num_neighbors`` parameter. The smaller the ``num_neighbors``, the faster the code will run.  See `here <http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.02653>`__ for more information on the methodological background.

* Both the Vecchia approximation and covariance tapering are techniques that work well for low-dimensional input features (e.g., spatial data). For higher-dimensional input features, it is less clear how well they perform. I.e., the GPBoost library currently does not implement a useful large-data approximation for non-low-dimensional input features for Gaussian processes. Work on this is in progress.

*Note: For Gaussian processes, there exist various other possible strategies (low-rank approximations, basis function expansions, spectral methods, full-scale approximations, etc.) such that computations scale well to large data which are currently not implemented. Contributions and suggestions are welcome.*
